- Persistent model state across sessions

### 2. Knowledge Management (`knowledge/knowledge_base.py`)

**KnowledgeBase Class:**
- Vector-based knowledge storage using FAISS
- SQLite database for structured metadata
- Semantic search capabilities

- Memory cleanup and optimization

### 4. User Interfaces (`interface/`)

**CLI Interface (`cli_interface.py`):**
- Command-line conversation interface
- Rich command set for learning and management
- Real-time interaction with auto-save
- Statistics and insights display

**Web Interface (`web_interface.py`):**
- Modern web-based chat interface
- REST API for all functionality
- Multi-session support
- Visual statistics dashboard

## Data Flow

```
User Input → Memory (Context) → Knowledge (Search) → AI Engine (Generate) → Response
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
  Learning    Context Storage   Relevance Update    Performance Track
```

1. **Input Processing:** User input is captured and added to conversation memory
2. **Context Retrieval:** Relevant conversation history and knowledge are retrieved
3. **Response Generation:** AI engine generates response using context
4. **Learning Integration:** Feedback and patterns are learned for future improvement
5. **Storage:** All interactions are persistently stored for continuous learning

{
  "ai_engine": {
    "vocab_size": 10000,
    "model_dim": 256,
    "learning_rate": 0.0001
  },
  "knowledge_base": {
    "embedding_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    "cache_size": 1000
  },
  "memory": {
    "context_window": 50,
    "cleanup_days": 90
  }
}
```

## API Reference

```python
from core.ai_engine import SelfLearningCore

ai = SelfLearningCore()
response = ai.generate_response("Hello", context="greeting")
ai.learn_from_feedback("input", "expected", score=0.9)
stats = ai.get_performance_stats()
```

### Knowledge Base

```python
from knowledge.knowledge_base import KnowledgeBase

kb = KnowledgeBase()
kb.add_knowledge("Python is a programming language", "Python", "programming")
results = kb.search_knowledge("programming language", top_k=5)
insights = kb.learn_from_interactions()
```

### Memory System

```python
from memory.conversation_memory import ConversationMemory

memory = ConversationMemory()
memory.add_message("user", "Hello AI")
context = memory.get_relevant_context("How are you?")
memory.update_user_profile("name", "John")
```

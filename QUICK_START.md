# Quick Start Guide - Portable AI Agent

Welcome to your personal AI assistant! This guide will get you up and running in just a few minutes.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Initialize the AI Agent
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "Porable Ai Agent"

# Run the initialization script
python initialize.py
```

This will:
- Install required dependencies
- Set up the directory structure
- Download AI models
- Create initial knowledge base
- Run system tests

### Step 2: Start Using Your AI

**Option A: Command Line Interface (Recommended for first time)**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Option B: Web Interface**
```bash
python main.py --web
# Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
```

## üéØ First Conversation

Once started, just type naturally:

```
ü§ñ > Hello! How are you?
ü§ñ Hello! I'm doing well and ready to help. I'm your personal AI assistant that learns from our conversations. What would you like to talk about?

ü§ñ > Can you help me learn Python?
ü§ñ Absolutely! Python is a great programming language to learn. What specific aspect of Python interests you - basics, web development, data science, or something else?

ü§ñ > I want to analyze data
ü§ñ Perfect! For data analysis, you'll want to learn about libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computing. Would you like me to explain how to get started?
```

## üìö Teaching Your AI

Your AI learns from every interaction! You can also explicitly teach it:

### Method 1: Using the 'learn' command
```
ü§ñ > learn What is Machine Learning? | Machine Learning is AI that learns from data without explicit programming 0.9
üìö Teaching: 'What is Machine Learning?' -> 'Machine Learning is AI that learns from data without explicit programming' (score: 0.9)
‚úÖ Learning completed! The AI will remember this for future conversations.
```

### Method 2: Adding knowledge
```
ü§ñ > knowledge Python is excellent for data science and has libraries like Pandas and NumPy | Python for Data Science | programming
‚úÖ Added knowledge item (ID: 123)
```

## üîç Useful Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `help` | Show all commands | `help` |
| `learn <input> \| <output> [score]` | Teach specific responses | `learn Hi \| Hello there! 0.8` |
| `knowledge <content> \| [title] \| [category]` | Add knowledge | `knowledge Python is great \| Python info \| programming` |
| `search <query>` | Search knowledge base | `search Python programming` |
| `stats` | Show performance metrics | `stats` |
| `profile set <key> <value>` | Set preferences | `profile set name John` |
| `profile show` | View your profile | `profile show` |
| `insights` | Get learning recommendations | `insights` |
| `save` | Save all data | `save` |
| `clear` | Clear screen | `clear` |
| `exit` | Exit the AI | `exit` |

## üåê Web Interface Features

Access at http://localhost:5000 after running `python main.py --web`

- **üí¨ Chat Tab**: Natural conversation with your AI
- **üìö Learn Tab**: Teach your AI specific responses
- **üß† Knowledge Tab**: Add knowledge and search
- **üìä Stats Tab**: View performance metrics

## üéì Learning Tips

### 1. **Start Conversations Naturally**
Just talk to your AI like you would to a person. It learns your communication style.

### 2. **Provide Feedback**
When the AI gives a good response, continue the conversation. When it's not quite right, use the `learn` command to correct it.

### 3. **Build Your Knowledge Base**
Add information about topics you care about using the `knowledge` command.

### 4. **Set Your Profile**
```
ü§ñ > profile set interests "Python, Data Science, AI"
ü§ñ > profile set experience_level "Beginner"
ü§ñ > profile set name "Your Name"
```

### 5. **Monitor Progress**
Use `stats` regularly to see how your AI is improving.

## üîí Privacy & Offline Operation

‚úÖ **Completely Offline**: Works without internet connection  
‚úÖ **Private**: All data stays on your device  
‚úÖ **Secure**: No data sent to external servers  
‚úÖ **Controlled**: You own and control all your data  

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Configuration File
Edit `config.json` to customize:
- Model parameters
- Memory settings
- Performance options
- Privacy settings

### Example config changes:
```json
{
  "memory": {
    "context_window": 100,
    "cleanup_days": 180
  },
  "interface": {
    "web_port": 8080
  }
}
```

## üìä Understanding Your AI's Learning

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Interactions**: How many conversations you've had
- **Learning Events**: How many times the AI has learned something new
- **Success Rate**: How well the AI is performing based on feedback
- **Knowledge Items**: Amount of information stored

### Signs Your AI is Learning Well
- Responses become more relevant to your interests
- Better understanding of your communication style
- Improved accuracy on topics you've taught
- More personalized responses

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Slow responses:**
- Check `stats` for performance metrics
- Consider reducing `context_window` in config
- Restart the AI periodically

**Memory issues:**
- Use `save` command regularly
- Set appropriate `cleanup_days` in config
- Monitor system resources

**Web interface not loading:**
```bash
# Try different port
python main.py --web --port 8080
```

### Getting Help
1. Use the `help` command for built-in assistance
2. Check `insights` for learning recommendations
3. Review the technical documentation in `TECHNICAL_DOCS.md`

## üéØ Next Steps

### Week 1: Getting Comfortable
- Have daily conversations
- Use basic commands
